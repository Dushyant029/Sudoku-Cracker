# Sudoku Cracker

This is a simple Python Script which can solve Sudoku by providing the Unsolved Sudoku in the script itself or can also solve in Android using ADB through an algorithm known as backtracking. Backtracking is simply reverting back to the previous step or solution as soon as we determine that our current solution cannot be continued into a complete one.
